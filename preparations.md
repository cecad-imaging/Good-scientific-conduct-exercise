## Instructor
 - Ask participants to install required software

    Dear participants of the good Scientific conduct course,

    in preparation of the exercises on the imaging part, please login to OMERO as soon as possible. To do this open https://omero-1.cecad.uni-koeln.de in your webbrowser and log in with your university (i.e. RRZK) account. If you do not have a university account, please notify me immediately.
    Please, do not forget to bring your computer to the course, having a proper mouse is probably helpful. Furthermore, I would kindly ask to already download and configure/install all the required software:

      + eduroam access (see https://rrzk.uni-koeln.de/anleitung-eduroam.html)
      + VPN (see https://rrzk.uni-koeln.de/anyconnect.html)
      + FIJI (https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads)
      All the OMERO downloads have to match the version of our OMERO server. The version number is stated below the login mask here: https://omero-1.cecad.uni-koeln.de
      + OMERO-FIJI plugin (OMERO.insight-ij-5.4.10-ice35-b105.zip, this needs to be extracted and the obtained folder should be moved to the plugins folder of your Fiji.app
      + OMERO.insight: OMERO.insight-5.4.10-ice35-b105-YOUR-OS.zip, be aware that you need the right version for your operating system (e.g. Windows). OMERO.insight requires Java JRE to be installed on your computer.

  If you have any questions or run into problems with the installation, please contact me before the course.

  See you,
  Peter
